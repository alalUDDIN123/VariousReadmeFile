## Directives

**Definition**:
Directives are a unique and powerful feature in Angular that allows developers to customize the behavior of HTML elements in the application.

Angular has three kinds of directives: 

- Component directives
- Attribute directives
- Structural directives.

**Use cases**:
Directives allow developers to organize code in a clean, readable way by allowing behavior modifications to DOM elements.
For example,

- **Component directives** are basically custom HTML elements that Angular can recognize.

- **Attribute directives** change the appearance or behavior of an existing element, component, or another directive. A common example of this is `NgStyle`` that lets you modify multiple styles at the same time.

- **Structural directives** alter the layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in DOM. NgFor and NgIf are the most common structural directives.

**Benefits**:
 They enhance HTML by allowing new syntax which leads to cleaner and more expressive templates.

**Extra information**:
Custom directives can also be created as per the application's needs in addition to the built-in directives provided by Angular. These can be highly reusable across the application which contributes to the modularity and maintainability of the codebase.
