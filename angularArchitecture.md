Angular is a popular framework for building web applications. Its architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which helps in organizing and structuring the codebase effectively. The basic architecture of an Angular application consists of several key components:

1. `Modules:` Angular applications are divided into modules, which are logical containers for different parts of the application. Each module encapsulates a set of related components, services, and other resources. Modules help in organizing the code and provide modularity and separation of concerns.

2. `Components:` Components are the building blocks of an Angular application's user interface. They represent specific parts of the application that have their own logic and UI. Each component consists of a TypeScript class that contains the component's properties and methods, along with an HTML template that defines the component's structure and layout.

3. `Templates:` Templates define the structure and layout of a component's view. They are written in HTML and may include Angular-specific syntax and directives. Templates allow developers to define how the component should be rendered and how data should be bound to the view.

4. `Directives:` Angular provides directives that allow you to extend HTML with additional functionality and create reusable components. Directives can be structural, such as *ngFor and *ngIf, which manipulate the DOM by adding or removing elements, or they can be attribute directives, which modify the behavior or appearance of an existing element.

5. `Services:` Services are used to encapsulate business logic, data retrieval, and other operations that are not directly related to the UI. Services provide a way to share data and functionality across different components. They are typically injected into components or other services using Angular's dependency injection mechanism.

6. `Dependency Injection (DI):` Angular's DI system is a fundamental part of its architecture. It allows you to define dependencies for a component or service and let Angular handle the instantiation and injection of those dependencies. DI promotes loose coupling and reusability by making components and services more modular and easier to test.

7. `Data Binding:` Angular provides powerful data binding capabilities that enable synchronization between the component's data and the view. Data binding can be one-way (from the component to the view or vice versa) or two-way, where changes in either the component or the view are automatically propagated to the other.

8. `Routing:` Angular's router allows you to define the navigation and routing rules of your application. It enables the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) by dynamically loading different components based on the current URL or user actions. The router manages the application's state and allows for deep linking and navigation between different views.

These are the key components and concepts that form the basic architecture of an Angular application.
