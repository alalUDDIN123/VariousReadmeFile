Angular modules serve as containers that group related logic, components, directives, services, and other Angular artifacts. They are one of the best ways to efficiently organize an Angular application.

The main purposes of Angular modules are:

1. Organize the application: Modules help in organizing and structuring the application by grouping related functionality together. This improves maintainability and readability of the codebase.

2. Reusability: Modules promote reusability by allowing encapsulated functionality to be easily reused in different parts of the application or even in other projects. This facilitates code sharing and modularity.

3. Lazy loading: Angular supports lazy loading of modules, enabling on-demand loading of modules when they are needed. This enhances the initial loading time of the application by loading only the necessary modules when navigating to specific routes.

Angular modules are defined using the @NgModule decorator in TypeScript. The @NgModule decorator provides the necessary metadata, including declarations, imports, providers, and more, to describe the module.
